# User Story Syntax Highlighting Tools

As a **Project Owner**, I want to **have a good set of tools**, so that I can **create and consume user stories quicker**.

The goal of this project is to create a set of tools to assist in the making of Agile User Stories and Acceptance Criteria. (http://www.allaboutagile.com/user-stories/)

## Wishlist:

 - [Syntax Highlighter Brush](https://github.com/syntaxhighlighter)
    - Compatible with JIRA
 - Emmet Shorthand Snippets
    - For faster writting of User Stories
 - Compatibilty with Popular Code editors (Sublime, TextMate, etc)


### Story Snippet Examples
 
*As a [user role], I want to [goal], so I can [reason].*

This is an example of what shorthand User Story snippets could look or work like.

`~?!` **>>** `As a {$1:user-role}, I want to {$2:goal}, so I can {$3:reason}.`

`~?`    **>>** `As a {$1:user-role}, I want to {$2:goal}.`


### Scenarios Snippet Examples

`!`    **>>** `GIVEN`

`!i`   **>>** `GIVEN that I am {$1:user-role}{\n|}`

`!u`   **>>** `GIVEN that you are a {$1:user-role}{\n|}`

`!i+`   **>>** `GIVEN that you are a {$1:user-role}{\n|}`


#### Stay tuned!
